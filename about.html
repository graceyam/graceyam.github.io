<h1>Hello! I'm Grace...</h1>
<h3>I am a senior at the University of San Francisco, double-majoring in Advertising and Performing Arts and Social Justice (Music), and minoring in Design. I am currently a Social Media Intern at Poshmark. In the past, I have also been a Creative Advertising Intern at Paramount Pictures, as well as been part of the marketing team for a couple startups. Artistically unbound â€“ I am a San Francisco-based artist who consistently and enthusiastically challenges my passions to produce art that initiates change, whether that be with music, graphic design, videography, or whatever it is that calls my creative spirit. With a roll-up-your-sleeves type of attitude and hunger to chase my curiosities, I am committed to living a story worth telling.
